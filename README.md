## Features

- **Success Score Predictor:**  
  Input your startup details and get a predicted success score (0-10) with actionable insights.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Explore startup data by country, industry, funding stage, and success categories.  
  Visualizations include pie charts, histograms, treemaps, geographic maps, and feature importance.

- **Model Insights:**  
  View feature importance from the trained model to understand what drives success predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above  
- Recommended to use a virtual environment  

### Installation

1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeLinguist-01/Startup_Success_Prediction.git
   cd Startup_Success_Prediction
   ```

## Files Needed

Make sure these files are present in your project folder:

- `model.pkl` â€” Trained ML model file  
- `scaler.pkl` â€” Scaler used for feature normalization  
- `input_columns.pkl` â€” Expected input features list  
- `startup_predictions-offline.csv` â€” Dataset with offline predictions  
- `Final-startup_success_predictions.csv` â€” Original startup data  
- `feature_importance.csv` â€” Feature importance values from the model  
- `app.py` â€” Main Streamlit app script  
- `requirements.txt` â€” Dependency list

## Running the App

Run the Streamlit app using:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
## How to Use

### Predict Success Score
- Fill the startup details form on the home page.  
- Click **Predict Success Score** to see the predicted score with interpretation.

### Explore Dashboard
Use the sidebar to navigate between:

- **Overview:** Filter startups by country, industry, funding stage; view key metrics and charts.  
- **Profile & Geography:** Analyze geographic spread and funding by industry.  
- **Model Insights:** View feature importance and dataset.

## About the Model

The model predicts startup success scores based on multiple features including funding, employees, valuation, industry, and funding stage. It uses scaled inputs and logistic regression or XGBoost under the hood.

Feature importance data explains which features impact predictions most.
